            <p>Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point-to-point (P2P), point-to-multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links. Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, stores, and other areas where security is needed. Though videotelephony is seldom called "CCTV" one exception is the use of video in distance education, where it is an important tool.

                Surveillance of the public using CCTV is common in many areas around the world. In recent years, the use of body worn video cameras has been introduced as a new form of surveillance, often used in law enforcement, with cameras located on a police officer's chest or head. Video surveillance has generated significant debate about balancing its use with individuals' right to privacy even when in public.
                
                In industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a central control room, for example when the environment is not suitable for humans. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.
                
                There are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years. The deployment of this technology has facilitated a significant growth in state surveillance, a substantial rise in the methods of advanced social monitoring and control, and a host of crime prevention measures throughout the world.</p>
            <p>When CCTV was first invented it was definitely a "closed circuit" but modern CCTV systems are nearly all networkable. The simple fact that you can network the system and stream the images over the internet, in theory make it an open circuit - of course the signal is encrypted and password protected, but it is certainly debatable whether it can be classed as a closed circuit. Obviously if you have an SD CCTV or HD over Coax system and choose not to physically connect it to the network, then it would still be a completely closed circuit.</p>
            <p>As already mentioned above there are several CCTV formats to choose from; SD CCTV (also known as Analogue CCTV), HD over Coax CCTV and IP CCTV.</p>
            <p><b>What format?</b></p>
            <p>Choosing the format is the most important decision you will make, the formats are not inter-compatible so take plenty of time when deciding. To read information about each format click on below links:</p>
